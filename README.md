# BSDSF23A020-OS-A01

## 📌 Operating Systems - Programming Assignment 01  

This project is part of the **Operating Systems** course assignment.  
The goal is to learn how real-world C projects are structured, built, and maintained using **multi-file compilation, static & dynamic libraries, Makefiles, and Git/GitHub workflows**.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Modular programming with header (`.h`) and source (`.c`) files  
- Creating and using **static (`.a`)** and **dynamic (`.so`)** libraries  
- Writing professional **Makefiles** for build automation  
- Using tools like `ar`, `nm`, `readelf`, `ldd` for binary analysis  
- Practicing **Git workflows** (branches, commits, tags, releases)  
- Writing **Linux man pages** for documentation
